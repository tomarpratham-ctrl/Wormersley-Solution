# Wormersley-Solution
Simulated 3D laminar flow in a circular tube to obtain the Wormsley velocity profile using ANSYS Fluent, including geometry creation, meshing, and solver setup.Developed and implemented a UDF in Fluent to prescribe the Wormsley profile.Validated CFD results by performing quantitative comparison between Fluent and MATLAB profiles
